#Project Management - the Stand-up routine
Does anyone here work for a living? Because this isn't going to of that much interest to any of you who don't.

My name is Mark Stringer - and amongst other things, I'm a stand-up commedian. What I'm going to talk about for the next 50 minutes or so is project management.  Now I know that this doesn't sound like suitable material for a stand-up routine but trust me, it is.
